        <h2 id="head2">Sea-Fever</h2>
            <p id="para1">I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,
                And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by;
                And the wheel’s kick and the wind’s song and the white sail’s shaking,
                And a grey mist on the sea’s face, and a grey dawn breaking.
                 
                I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide
                Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;
                And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,
                And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.
                 
                I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,
                To the gull’s way and the whale’s way where the wind’s like a whetted knife;
                And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,
                And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick’s over.</p></hr>
