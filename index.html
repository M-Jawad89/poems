        <h2 id="head2">Flowers by the Sea
            BY WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS</h2>
            <p id="para1">When over the flowery, sharp pasture’s
                edge, unseen, the salt ocean
                
                lifts its form—chicory and daisies
                tied, released, seem hardly flowers alone
                
                but color and the movement—or the shape
                perhaps—of restlessness, whereas
                
                the sea is circled and sways
                peacefully upon its plantlike stem</p></hr>
